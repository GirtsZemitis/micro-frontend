  "description": "The one and only traditional Singaporean breakfast – Kaya Toast with Soft-Boiled Eggs. The traditional bread is an old school rectangular white loaf, toasted on a bread grill, lathered with coconut or egg kaya, then slapped with a thick slice of SCS butter that slowly melts within two slices of warm bread.\nFor the eggs, they’re usually placed in a large hot water metal pot and covered with a plate. Then you time it and take out the eggs when they’re ready (about 7 – 10 minutes depending on how well you like your eggs)."
